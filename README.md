# CmA_F_Agt-NDA
NDA on form derived from CooleyGo.  Highly granular, with many alternatives to tailor to purpose. 

NDA based originally on a CooleyGo form (with permission but without endorsement). It has been significantly modified.

The sections (in /Sec/) have common-sense names.  There are a number of alternative provisions that show some ways to create and share alternatives. 

This repo is also mounted as part of source.commonaccord.org - the rendered doc is at http://source.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=doc&file=G/CmA_Agt-NDA/Sec/0.md.  A demo of an actual agreement is at http://source.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=source&file=F/Demo/Agt_NDA.md.
