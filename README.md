NDA on form derived from CooleyGo.  Highly granular, with many alternatives for tailoring to purpose. 

NDA based originally on a CooleyGo form (with permission but without endorsement). It has been significantly modified.

The sections (in /Sec/) have common-sense names.  There are a number of alternative provisions that show some ways to create and share alternatives.
