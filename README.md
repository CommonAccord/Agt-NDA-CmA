NDA based originally on a CooleyGo form (with permission but without endorsement). It has been significantly modified.

The sections (in /Sec/) have common-sense names.  There are a number of alternative provisions that show some ways to create and share alternatives. 

This repo is also mounted as part of source.commonaccord.org - with demos of completed NDAs at <a href="http://source.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=G/Agt-NDA-CmA/Demo/">http://source.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=G/Agt-NDA-CmA/Demo/</a>.
